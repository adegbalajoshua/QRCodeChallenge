## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Learnt hot to center a div, create box shadows and got to play around with CSS units 


```html
<div class="container">
 
</div>
```
```css
.container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    height: 420px;
    width: 270px;
}
```

### Continued development

Found it a little challenging to center divs and center elements inside said div. Would have to brush up on some basic CSS concepts again to referesh my memory
